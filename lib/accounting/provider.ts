/**
 * Provider-neutral accounting integration seam.

 * SCOPE: This is a SYNC SCAFFOLD to an external book-of-record (FlowAccount /
 * PEAK / Xero) — NOT an accounting or tax engine. We do not generate tax
 * invoices or compute VAT here. We map our internal invoice to a
 * provider-neutral payload and hand it to a provider adapter.
 *
 * The `pushInvoice` implementations below are deliberate STUBS: they return a
 * deterministic fake external id and perform NO network I/O (there are no
 * credentials in this MVP). The interface is the clean seam a real provider
 * client (HTTP + OAuth) drops into later — see the marked spot in each stub.
