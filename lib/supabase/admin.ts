 * must NEVER be imported into client code or exposed to the browser. Use it only
 * in trusted server contexts that have no user session and authenticate by other
 * means — e.g. the cron route, which validates an `X-Cron-Secret` header before
 * touching data. Every query made through this client must scope `org_id`
 * itself, because RLS will not do it for you.
 *
 * The service-role key lives in `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server env only) and
 * must never be logged or returned in a response.
